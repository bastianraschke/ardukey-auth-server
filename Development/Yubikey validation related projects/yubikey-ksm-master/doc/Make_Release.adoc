Maintainer instructions for making releases
-------------------------------------------

The point of this document is to describe all steps required to make a
proper release of the yubikey-personalization project.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Making a release requires the following packages:

  make, git, gnupg, help2man, git2cl

which can be installed (under Ubuntu) by running:

  sudo apt-get install make git gnupg help2man git2cl

Details
~~~~~~~

* Make sure the version number in Makefile has been incremented.

* Make sure NEWS describes all changes since the last release.  Use
  'git log -p' to review.

* Change the '(unreleased)' part in NEWS to '(released 20XX-YY-ZZ)'
  and commit that with a note 'Version Q.P'.

* Run 'make release'.

* Increment version number in Makefile and add a NEWS template for the
  next release.
