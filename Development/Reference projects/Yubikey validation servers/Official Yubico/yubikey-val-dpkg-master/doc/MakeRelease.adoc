Maintainer instructions for making releases
===========================================

== Introduction

The point of this document is to describe all steps required to make a
proper release of the yubikey-personalization project.

== Dependencies

Making a release requires the following packages:

  make, git, gnupg, git2cl

which can be installed (under Ubuntu) by running:

  sudo apt-get install make git gnupg git2cl

== Details

* Make sure the doc/ sub-directory uses the latest revision.  Confirm with:
  cd doc && git checkout master && git pull && git diff

* Make sure the version number in Makefile has been incremented.

* Make sure NEWS describes all changes since the last release.  Use https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-val/commits/master to review.

* Change the '(unreleased)' part in NEWS to '(released 20XX-YY-ZZ)' and commit that with a note 'Version Q.P'.

* Run 'make release'.

* Increment version number in Makefile and add a NEWS template for the next release.
