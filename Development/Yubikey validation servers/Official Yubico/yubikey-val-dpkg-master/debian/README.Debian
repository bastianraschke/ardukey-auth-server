yubikey-val for Debian
----------------------

This package contains the YubiKey Validation (YK-VAL) server.

Upon installation, a client API Key will be generated if none exists.
On a fresh installation it will generally have an ID of 1 and a
randomly generated secret key. To view the key, you may use the
following command:

sudo ykval-export-clients

More clients can be generated by using the ykval-gen-clients command.
For more information, you may use the man command for both of these
commands.
