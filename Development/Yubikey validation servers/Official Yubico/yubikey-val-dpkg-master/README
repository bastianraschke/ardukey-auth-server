YubiKey OTP Validation Server
=============================

The YubiKey Validation Server (YK-VAL) is a server that validates
Yubikey One-Time Passwords (OTPs).  YK-VAL is written in PHP, for use
behind web servers such as Apache.

General
-------

The server implements the Yubico API protocol as defined in
doc/ValidationProtocol* and further documentation is also available in
the doc/ subdirectory.

This server talks to a KSM service for decrypting the OTPs, to avoid
storing any AES keys on the validation server.  One implementation of
this service is the YubiKey-KSM --
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-ksm/ -- and another
implementation using the YubiHSM hardware is PyHSM:

Note that version 1.x is a minimal centralized server. Version 2.x is
a replicated system that uses multiple machines.
