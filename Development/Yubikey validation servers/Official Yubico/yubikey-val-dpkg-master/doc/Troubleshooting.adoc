First check if the web server is working.

Check that PHP is working.  Create a foo.php script containing '<?php
phpinfo(); ?>' to debug PHP configuration.

Next make sure you serve the YK-VAL code under the URL you want, and
that accesssing the URL reaches the YK-VAL code.  PHP error log in the
file set by php.ini error_log, by default /var/log/apache2/error.log.
Database errors will also be logged into it.

The database needs to be started.  Make sure you can access it and the
tables.

If 'ykval-export' crashes, you may be running into a compatibility
problem between PHP, curl and libpq.  See
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=411982 for more
information.  The workaround is simple:

 user@val:~$ sudo mv /etc/php5/conf.d/curl.ini /etc/php5/conf.d/z_curl.ini
