API documentation
----

In doc/html/ you will find API documentation generated from pydoc in the
source tree at the time of release.

If you have checked out the source code from the repository rather than
downloaded an official release, you can generate the HTML API documentation
yourself by installing 'epydoc' (package 'python-epydoc' in Debian/Ubuntu)
and then executing the ./maintainer-scripts/generate_html.sh script.
