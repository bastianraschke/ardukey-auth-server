All scripts should be run from the main directory.

make-release.sh
---------------
Creates and signs a release, placing the resulting files in 
../releases/ (outside the parent directory). Prior to invoking 
this script, a signed tag should have been made using the version
as name.

generate_html.sh
-------------
Generates the HTML documentation in doc/html/. This file is
called by make-release.sh and does not need to be called by
itself.
