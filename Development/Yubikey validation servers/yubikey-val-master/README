===========

The YubiKey Validation Server (YK-VAL) is a server that validates
Yubikey OTPs.  YK-VAL is written in PHP, for use with web servers such
as Apache.

The server implements the Yubico API protocol as defined in
doc/ValidationProtocol*.

This server talks to another service for decrypting the OTPs, to avoid
storing any AES keys within the validation server. One implementation
of this service is YKKSM:

Another implementation of a KSM using the YubiHSM hardware is
Python-PyHSM:

Note that version 1.x is a minimal centralized server. Version 2.x is
a replicated system that uses multiple machines.
